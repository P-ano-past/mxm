                <p>Hello, my name is Marc! My past career has involved desktop support and am now transitioning into Web Development. I've studied for a little over a year on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS before joining a coding camp in January of 2020. In the era of MySpace when everyone was able to modify their profiles, I was one of the people constantly changing various lines of code, paying close attention to what broke and what worked.
                </p>
                <p id="p2">Now I'm one of the people making the web pages for people to tinker around with! Although I've started a bit late, I'm happy to research and apply my findings to see a project come to life. In the future I hope to see people enjoying what I've created for them. Even if they don't know it was me that created it!
